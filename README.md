## About ðŸš€
NyxForge is a meticulously crafted Turborepo starter template designed to accelerate the development of modern, scalable, and high-performance Next.js applications. Built with developer experience and production readiness in mind, NyxForge bundles essential tools and preconfigured packages into a cohesive monorepo structure, allowing teams to focus on building features instead of wrestling with configurations.

## Getting Started ðŸŒ±

```bash
npx nyxforge@latest init
or
npx @parazeeknova/nyxforge@latest init
```

##  Package Availability ðŸ“¦
NyxForge is distributed through multiple package registries to ensure reliable access:

- **NPM Registry**: `npx nyxforge@latest init`
  - The primary distribution channel
  - Available globally through npmjs.com

- **GitHub Packages**: `npx @parazeeknova/nyxforge@latest init`
  - Alternative distribution channel
  - Directly integrated with GitHub's ecosystem

Both versions are identical in functionality and are automatically synchronized through our CI/CD pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> Github package release may have a version mismatch with the NPM package. But both packages are identical in functionality. (ex: 0.0.11 in NPM may be 0.0.10 in Github)
